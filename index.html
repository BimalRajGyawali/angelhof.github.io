<h1 class="page-heading">Short bio</h1>

<p class="homepage">
  Before my PhD, I was an undergraduate student at the <a href="https://www.ntua.gr/en/">National Technical University of Athens</a>, department of <a href="https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a>. I completed my thesis “HiPErJiT: A Profile-Driven Just-in-Time Compiler for Erlang based on HiPE” under the supervision of <a href="http://user.it.uu.se/~kostis/">Kostis Sagonas</a>. It is available online in both <a href="/files/thesis.pdf">English</a> and <a href="/files/thesis_gr.pdf">Greek</a>.

  In May of 2018 I participated in the <a href="http://fm.csl.sri.com/SSFT18/">Eighth Summer School on Formal Techniques</a> that took place in Atherton, California and was organized by <a href="https://www.sri.com/">SRI International</a>.

  Throughout my undergraduate studies I have developed software for many projects with my colleagues. Some notable examples are a complete compiler for the language Edsger (<a href="https://github.com/angelhof/edsger_compiler">source</a>), an implementation of the Chord protocol (<a href="https://github.com/angelhof/chord-distributed-erlang">source</a>), and an extension of the SIP Communicator (<a href="https://github.com/angelhof/sip-project-extensions">source</a>).

  I have also participated in Google Summer of Code 2017, where I worked with <a href="https://github.com/zinid">Evgeny Khramtsov</a> to extend <a href="https://github.com/processone/ejabberd">ejabberd</a>. I implemented a mechanism that allows for certificate acquiring through the <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-acme/acme">ACME</a> protocol.

  In my free time I enjoy programming (for fun or in programming competitions), board games, escape rooms, and ping pong. I also occasionally play the guitar in an amateur jam band.
