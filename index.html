<h2 class="page-heading">Overview</h2>

<p class="homepage">
  I am a PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania, where I am
  fortunate to be advised
  by <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur/">Rajeev Alur</a>. My
  research interests lie in the intersection of programming
  languages, distributed systems, and software verification.

  I have done an internship in Microsoft Research, where I worked with
  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sburckha/">Sebastian Burckhardt</a>,
  and an internship in the Automated Reasoning Group in AWS, where I worked with 
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-schwartz-narbonne-5036b9137/">Daniel Schwartz-Narbonne</a>.
  Before my PhD, I did my undergraduate studies at the National Technical University of Athens,
  where I was advised by <a href="http://user.it.uu.se/~kostis/">Kostis Sagonas</a>.

  <b>Note:</b>
  I am committed to ensuring that everyone feels comfortable being part of our research community.
  I am always happy to talk to anyone (junior or senior) who feels like they want to share or discuss anything; be it a negative (or positive) experience, an interaction with another member of our community, or an issue with university and other processes.
  I have often needed to seek help myself and found that having access to a listening ear is very helpful.

  Together with <a href="http://nikos.vasilak.is/">Nikos Vasilakis</a> and (more recently) 
  <a href="https://mgree.github.io/">Michael Greenberg</a>, we are 
  leading a research project on the automatic parallelization of shell scripts.
  The ultimate goal is to improve our understanding of the shell, 
  approaching it from a programming languages viewpoint, and build frameworks
  that enable further studies and analyses on it.
  
  We have described this vision for the future of the shell in 
  <a href="/files/papers/shell-2021-hotos.pdf">this paper</a>
  that appeared in HotOS '21, where we also organized a 
  <a href="https://fut-shell.github.io/">panel</a> 
  on future avenues for shell research.
</p>

<p class="homepage">
  The paper that started this research was published at EuroSys 2021 
  (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447786.3456228">link</a>).
  One of the main challenges that we had to overcome is that shell commands
  are arbitrary black boxes that can be written in a plethora of programming languages,
  making any analysis infeasible.
  We addressed that by developing an annotation language that captures a few key properties
  of shell commands that can then be used by our system to parallelize a script.
  These annotations are written once per command, and can be shared among users
  in the form of annotation libraries.
  
  We have also formalized an order-aware dataflow model 
  that is equivalent to a "scheduling-free" fragment of the shell
  (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3473570">paper link</a>).
  We use this model as an convenient representation on which we apply transformations that expose parallelism.
  After we are done parallelizing, the dataflow graph is transformed back to a shell script that can
  execute on any standard shell.

  Existing abstractions for stream processing either consider streams to either be totally ordered sequences,
  completely unordered relations, or some fixed point in between, e.g., CQL considers streams to be sequences of relations.

  However, these representations face a number of issues.
  If a representation does not capture adequate order, streaming queries can produce erroneous results
  due to nondeterminism and out-of-order input data.
  If a representation is "too ordered", then it does not expose available parallelism,
  and optimizations due to lack of order.
  We propose a flexible partial order abstraction that can capture fine-grained ordering requirements,
  allowing for correct and maximally parallel stream processing.

  Our first paper on this work was published at OOPSLA 2020
  (<a href="https://dl-acm-org.proxy.library.upenn.edu/doi/abs/10.1145/3428221">link</a>),
  where we describe a differential testing framework 
  (<a href="https://github.com/fniksic/diffstream">code</a>)
  for stream processing applications that allows
  users to define the ordering requirements on their application's output, improving testing accuracy.

  We are also working on a programming model that can exploit the partially ordered nature of the input stream,
  generating highly parallel implementations. This work is under submission, 
  but a prototype of the code is available on 
  (<a href="https://github.com/angelhof/flumina">Github</a>).
