<h1 class="page-heading">Short bio</h1>
<p>I am currently finishing my degree at the <a href="https://www.ntua.gr/en/">National Technical University of Athens</a>, department of <a href="https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a>. At the moment I am writing my thesis on “Erlang Just in Time compilation” under the supervision of Professor <a href="http://user.it.uu.se/~kostis/">Kostis Sagonas</a>.</p>
<p>My research interests are programming languages design and implementation, type theory, compilers, and distributed systems. I am particularly interested in ways of making software and programming in general more reliable and secure.</p>
<p>Throughout my studies I have developed software for many projects with my colleagues. Some notable examples are:  a complete compiler for the language Edsger - <a href="https://github.com/angelhof/edsger_compiler">link</a>, an implementation of the Chord protocol - <a href="https://github.com/angelhof/chord-distributed-erlang">link</a>, and an extension of the SIP Communicator - <a href="https://github.com/angelhof/sip-project-extensions">link</a>.</p>
<p>I have also participated in Google Summer of Code 2017, where I worked with <a href="https://github.com/zinid">Evgeny Khramtsov</a> to extend <a href="https://github.com/processone/ejabberd">ejabberd</a>. We implemented a mechanism that allows for certificate acquiring through the <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-acme/acme">ACME</a> protocol.</p>
<p>In my free time I enjoy programming for fun or in programming competitions. I also like playing the guitar, mostly improvising with friends.</p>
