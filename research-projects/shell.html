  Shell programs are ubiquitous (steadily in top 10 programming languages for the 
  last decade according to 
  <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/2022/top-programming-languages">Github's survey</a>)
  due to the shell's unique features:
    simple command composition and easy access to the state of the whole system.
  
  Unfortunately, these features hinder optimizations on shell scripts to scale to handle
  contemporary workloads and utilize available resources.

  The goal of my research is to develop bolt-on systems that automatically scale out shell scripts
  with theoretical and practical correctness guarantees.

<!-- <p class="homepage">
  Together with <a href="http://nikos.vasilak.is/">Nikos Vasilakis</a> and
  <a href="https://mgree.github.io/">Michael Greenberg</a>, we are 
  leading a research project on the automatic parallelization of shell scripts.
  The ultimate goal is to improve our understanding of the shell, 
  approaching it from a programming languages viewpoint, and build frameworks
  that enable further studies and analyses on it.
  
  We have described this vision for the future of the shell in 
  <a href="/files/papers/shell-2021-hotos.pdf">this paper</a>
  that appeared in HotOS '21, where we also organized a 
  <a href="https://fut-shell.github.io/">panel</a> 
  on future avenues for shell research.

  The paper that started this research was published at EuroSys 2021 
  (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447786.3456228">link</a>).
  One of the main challenges that we had to overcome is that shell commands
  are arbitrary black boxes that can be written in a plethora of programming languages,
  making any analysis infeasible.
  We addressed that by developing an annotation language that captures a few key properties
  of shell commands that can then be used by our system to parallelize a script.
  These annotations are written once per command, and can be shared among users
  in the form of annotation libraries.
  
  We have also formalized an order-aware dataflow model 
  that is equivalent to a "scheduling-free" fragment of the shell
  (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3473570">paper link</a>).
  We use this model as an convenient representation on which we apply transformations that expose parallelism.
  After we are done parallelizing, the dataflow graph is transformed back to a shell script that can
  execute on any standard shell.
