<p class="homepage">
I am always looking for highly motivated students with 
experience in computer systems, compilers, and/or programming languages.

My interests are broad and evolve faster than my website update
frequency, so the best way to determine what research we could do together 
is to email me! 
</p>

<p class="homepage">
When emailing me try to dedicate some time to
tailor the email and convey genuine interest.

For example, what exactly motivated you to reach out to me? 
What is your background and research experience?
Is there any prior paper (or research thread) of mine 
that particularly sparked your interest (either due to topic or style)?
</p>
