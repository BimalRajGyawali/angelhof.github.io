<h2 id="group" class="page-heading">Advice for prospective students</h2>

<p class="homepage">
I am always looking for highly motivated students with 
experience in computer systems, compilers, and/or programming languages.

My interests are broad and evolve faster than my website update
frequency, so the best way to determine what research we could do together 
is to email me! 
</p>

<p class="homepage">
When emailing me try to dedicate some time to
tailor the email and convey genuine interest.

For example, what exactly motivated you to reach out to me? 
What is your background and research experience?
Is there any prior paper (or research thread) of mine 
that particularly sparked your interest (either due to topic or style)?
</p>

<p class="homepage">
If you don't have prior research experience, that is OK, we all start from somewhere!
One way you could show that you can independently tackle a problem is 
if you first try to resolve a Github issue in one of my repositories, 
such as <a href="https://github.com/binpash/pash">PaSh</a>
or any other repository in the 
<a href="https://github.com/binpash">binpash</a> project.
Feel free to post questions in the Github issue or on the PaSh discord server.
