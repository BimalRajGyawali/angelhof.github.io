# About me

I am currently finishing my degree at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/), department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en). At the moment I am writing my Thesis on "Erlang Just in Time compilation" under the supervision of Professor [Kostis Sagonas](http://user.it.uu.se/~kostis/).

My research interests are programming languages design and implementation, type theory, compilers and distributed systems. I am particularly interested in ways of making software and programming in general more reliable and secure.

Throughout my studies I have developed software for many projects with my colleagues. Some notable examples are:  a complete compiler for the language Edsger - [link](https://github.com/angelhof/edsger_compiler), an implementation of the Chord protocol - [link](https://github.com/angelhof/chord-distributed-erlang) and an extension of the SIP Communicator - [link](https://github.com/angelhof/sip-project-extensions). 

I have also participated in Google Summer of Code 2017, where I worked with [Evgeny Khramtsov](https://github.com/zinid) to extend [ejabberd](https://github.com/processone/ejabberd). We implemented a mechanism that allows for certificate acquiring through the [ACME](https://github.com/ietf-wg-acme/acme) protocol.

In my free time I enjoy programming for fun or in programming competitions. I also like playing guitar, mostly improvising with friends.
