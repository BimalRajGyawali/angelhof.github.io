title: Advice for prospective PhD students on deciding which program to join

I wanted to write this post for some time now since the longer I wait,
the more my viewpoint diverges from the one I had when I was a
prospective PhD student. At the moment, my memory of looking for PhD
programs is still pretty fresh, but I have also seen the process from
the other side, getting to know some other students and whether their
decisions played out well or not. The goal of this post is to propose
some advice regarding picking a university for your PhD. Note that
this is all very subjective (and non complete), meaning that you
should take it into account together with information and advice from
other sources. Also note that I am doing a PhD in the field of
Computer Science, so the advice might not be as relevant to students
in other fields.

I often see that prospective PhD students (myself included) heavily
weigh their options based on the research interests of faculty
members. Event though this is important to factor in your decision, I
believe that in the end of the day, it doesn't correlate that much
with satisfaction from the PhD program for two reasons. First of all,
it is extremely difficult to correctly assess what are someone's
research interests before you work with them, especially considering
that faculty members often don't maintain their websites. Second, I
think that the specifics of your PhD research are often left abstract
until the very last moment---even senior PhDs often don't have a very
precise plan of their research agenda.

In contrast, what matters a lot for many people is the daily
interaction with their advisors and group. Being content during the
everyday struggles of a PhD depends a little on whether you are
optimizing a compiler pass or a distributed system, and more on
whether you appreciate and enjoy working with your collaborators. If
your advisor wants to micromanage you but you prefer a more
independent relationship, you might suffer even if you work on your
favorite problem. Of course this is mostly based on my own experience,
and it might be different for you.

Before moving forward I would like to note that my opinion is biased
since I have been fortunate to be surrounded by amazing collaborators,
a lot of which are now my dear friends. This includes my advisor, who
is extremely supportive, helpful, and flexible, the other faculty
members in the group, who are also very helpful and supportive, and
finally the other students and researchers, with all of whom I have an
amazing relationship.

Based on the above assertion, i.e. that a PhD student's relationship
with their advisor and collaborators is more important than their
exact research topic, I would like to give some advice on how
prospective PhD students can pick a group to join. Even though the
prospective relationship with an advisor is very hard to predict and
difficult to assess from brief visits or chats, there are several
qualities that an advisor can have and don't work for most
people. Based on this, I think that there are a couple things that one
should do to improve the chance that they end up with an advisor that
they like working with.

In my opinion the most impactful action by far is asking tons of
questions to everyone: present and past PhD students, postdocs, and
faculty members. Especially with students and postdocs, it helps if
the questions are not abstract, but concrete things that some people
might even feel a little uncomfortable answering. Of course the goal
is not to make people feel uncomfortable, but rather to get
as-honest-as-possible opinions on important matters. The good thing is
that after you are accepted in the program, there is nothing that can
go wrong, so you have nothing to worry about when asking these
questions.

Asking questions could help figure out if there are students that have
any issues with the faculty member that you are interested in working
with. Possible issues could be (but are certainly not limited to):

- Being overworked
- Having no guidance or help
- Being overly micromanaged
- Lack of any interest from the faculty member
- General bad attitude and communication

Even though it is difficult for people to be completely honest with
strangers, there is a lot that one can get out of their responses. In
my experience, people tend to positively boost their responses to
these types of questions, e.g. if a PhD student is unhappy with their
advisor, they won't express their discontent, but they might just say
OK things about them. Spotting a lack of enthusiasm or positivity and
poking it with more questions could lead to some important information
about possible issues. Furthermore, if more than one person has
similar opinions about a faculty member, this strongly indicates that
the opinion might indeed be valid.

Since the goal is to figure out the bad aspects of the working
environment, it is beneficial talking with past PhD students too,
since they might feel more comfortable opening up about issues; in
contrast to current students whose future depends a lot on their
advisor's future too.

Here are some concrete questions that one could ask (current and
past) PhD students and research assistants:

+ What is the worst quality about your advisor?
+ Is there something that you don't enjoy in your everyday life
  while working with advisor?
+ How do you like interacting/working with advisor?
+ What is the usual interaction that you have with advisor?
+ How does your advisor check for progress? Do you have weekly
  meetings? Progress reports, etc?

Finally, it is important to consider universities that have a diverse
group of faculty that you would to work with, as well as allow (and
ideally encourage) collaboration and experimentation with different
faculty members at the beginning of your PhD. As far as I know this is
mostly applicable in the US, where prospective students are accepted
by the department and are not necessarily tied to a specific professor
from the beginning. The reason why this is important is obvious; in
the end of the day, it is possible to initially misjudge a person, and
only figure out that you don't totally align with them after the
fact. Being in a university where working with different advisors or
changing advisor is easy, gives you an opportunity to continue with
your PhD without leaving the program. Even better, the ability to work
with several people in your first couple years allows you to get more
data and then make an educated decision of you want to work with.

To summarize, I believe that when people decide which PhD program to
join, they often think more about their research interests, and less
about the future relationship with their advisor, assuming that it
will be fine by default. However in my experience, PhD student
dissatisfaction stems very often from issues related to a student's
interaction with their advisor. An unhealthy student-advisor
relationship can not be easily solved, often forcing the student to
leave the program. On the other hand, if the relationship is good, a
healthy solution can be found to most of the other issues that might
arise during the degree.
