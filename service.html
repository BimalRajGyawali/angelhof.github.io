  Together with <a href="https://manosth.github.io/">Manos Theodosis</a> we co-created 
  <a href="https://manosth.github.io/mentoring_initiative/">CS PhD MentoRes</a> in 2021, 
  a mentoring initiative for people that are interested in applying for PhD programs 
  in Computer Science and related fields but don't have access to adequate resources.

  If you are interested in applying for a PhD (or just want to know more about what it entails), contact us!
